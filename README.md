# hospital-charges-analysis
i will get insight from the 'hospital-charges' data using GOOGLE SHEETS.
1. we will make this data 'tidy data' ,which include deleting cell which spread on multiple cells, write the repeating data in another table, checking if a varible is taking multiple columns(just so that it can be in centre).
Following three rules makes a dataset tidy: variables are in columns, observations are in rows, and values are in cells.
